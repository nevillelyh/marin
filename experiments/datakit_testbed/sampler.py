"""Post-normalize by-provenance sampler for the Datakit Testbed.

For each source, copy a subset of its *normalized* parquet shards.

Why post-normalize rather than pre:

* Normalize already targets ``target_partition_bytes`` per output shard, so
  the post-normalize shards are **uniform in size**. "First K by filename"
  becomes byte-fair by construction — no hash ordering needed.
* Normalize's ``group_by`` redistributes records across shards by
  ``hash(id)``, so output shards are content-decorrelated from input
  ordering. First-K is also content-fair.
* Row counts are exact (parquet footer), so in-shard row-level targets are
  possible later if we want finer granularity.

Design choices:

* **Deterministic, no RNG.** Sort by filename, take first K. Reproducible
  across ferry reruns.
* **Copy, not manifest.** GCS has no symlinks; a manifest would force a
  downstream API change. Intra-region GCS copy has no network egress — only
  the storage of the sampled subset.
* **Fraction per source** is computed upstream from ``rough_token_count_b``
  against ``RAW_TARGET_TOTAL_TOKENS_B`` via :func:`proportional_sample_fractions`.
