"""common-pile/* download + normalize helpers.

27 filtered subsets of the common-pile v0.1 corpora. Each entry is a standalone
HF repo (``common-pile/<subset>_filtered``, or ``common-pile/stackv2`` as the
one exception); no shared family download, no custom preprocessing beyond what
normalize does. Thin wrapper over :func:`hf_normalize_steps`.

The download HF ids end in ``_filtered`` because Marin re-publishes curated
variants of the canonical common-pile repos; the token-count-viewer's CSV
shows the user-facing unfiltered names, but what actually downloads (and what
the staged dirs on GCS hold) is the ``_filtered`` version.
