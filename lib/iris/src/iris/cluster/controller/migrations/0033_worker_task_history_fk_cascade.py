"""Add ON DELETE CASCADE FK on ``worker_task_history.task_id -> tasks(task_id)``.

Prior to this migration ``worker_task_history`` had no FK on ``task_id``, so
``remove_finished_job`` (which cascades from ``jobs`` -> ``tasks`` ->
``task_attempts``) left ``worker_task_history`` rows orphaned. Resubmitting a
job with the same ``job_id`` produced fresh ``tasks`` rows that silently
re-attached to the stale history — the fingerprint that was mis-diagnosed as
the reservation-holder reset branch misfiring during the 2026-04-16 outage.

SQLite can't add a FK via ALTER TABLE, so follow the standard
create-new/copy/drop/rename dance, dropping orphan rows in the copy (that's
the whole point; otherwise the FK would be violated the moment we turn it on)
and recreating every index that existed on the old table.

Superseded by migration 0041 (``worker_task_history`` is dropped wholesale).
On fresh DBs the table is no longer created by 0001, so this migration
short-circuits.
