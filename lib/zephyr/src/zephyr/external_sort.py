"""Two-pass external merge sort for large k-way merges.

Used by the reduce stage when the number of sorted chunk iterators exceeds
``EXTERNAL_SORT_FAN_IN``, to avoid opening O(k) scanners simultaneously and
exhausting worker memory.

Pass 1: batch the k iterators into groups of ``fan_in`` (defaulting to
``EXTERNAL_SORT_FAN_IN`` but typically lowered via :func:`compute_fan_in` to
fit the worker's memory budget), merge each group with ``heapq.merge``, and
spill items to a run file under ``{external_sort_dir}/run-{i:04d}.spill`` via
:class:`SpillWriter`.

Pass 2: heapq.merge over the (much smaller) set of run file iterators.  Each
iterator streams chunks from its spill file via :class:`SpillReader`; the read
batch size is computed from the cgroup memory limit so that all concurrent
batches together stay within ``_READ_MEMORY_FRACTION`` of available memory.

Run files are deleted after the final merge completes.
