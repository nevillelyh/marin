"""Job-based execution engine for Zephyr pipelines.

The coordinator runs as a fray *job* that internally creates coordinator and
worker *actors* as child jobs. Workers pull tasks from the coordinator actor,
execute shard operations, and report results back. Because actors are children
of the coordinator job, Iris cascading termination automatically cleans them
up when the coordinator exits or is killed — preventing stale-coordinator
bugs where orphaned coordinators and workers consume resources indefinitely.

        resources: Resource config per worker.
        coordinator_resources: Resource config for the coordinator job. Defaults to 2 GB.
        chunk_storage_prefix: Storage prefix for intermediate chunks. If None, defaults

        name: Descriptive name for this context, used in actor group names for debugging.

        max_execution_retries: Maximum number of times to retry a pipeline execution after
            an infrastructure failure (e.g., coordinator VM preemption). Application errors
            (ZephyrWorkerError) are never retried. Defaults to 100.
